# Raindrops Game
A simple Pygame project where raindrops fall from the top of the screen, and new raindrops appear at the top when they disappear from the bottom. This project is based on Exercise 13-3 and 13-4 from the book Python Crash Course. 
---
## Features
- Raindrops fall continuously from top to bottom of the screen.
- When raindrops disappear off the bottom, new raindrops are generated at the top.
- Designed using Pygame for graphics and animations.
- Includes a grid of raindrops that dinamically adjust based on screen size.
---
## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Pygame library.
  Install Pygame using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
